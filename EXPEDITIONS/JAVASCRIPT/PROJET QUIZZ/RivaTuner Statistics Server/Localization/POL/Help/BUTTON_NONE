Disables detection for the application associated with the current profile. In this mode %PRODUCTNAME% doesn't collect runtime statistics, such as framerate, and doesn't provide additional services, such as On-Screen Display, to the associated application.

Wskazówki:

To troubleshoot such issues try to add a profile for such application and decrease application detection level.

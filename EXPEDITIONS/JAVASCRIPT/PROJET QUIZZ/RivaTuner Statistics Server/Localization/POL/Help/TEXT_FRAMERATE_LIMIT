Limit klatek na sekundê
Allows defining framerate limit for 3D applications. Limiting the framerate during gaming can help to reduce the power consumption as well as it can improve gaming experience due to removing unwanted microstutteing effect caused by framerate fluctuations. Set it to zero to disable the limit.
This option is profile specific, so you can configure it independently for different applications.

Wskazówki:

Framerate limiting mode
Allows selecting one of the following framerate limiting modes, with different priorities and serving for different purposes:

- Async - prioritizes strict minimum frametime (and maximum framerate) limit over anything else. In this mode the limiter never allows hooked 3D application to start rendering new frame until time since starting the previous frame rendering exceeds the limit.  In this mode frame start timings are synchronized to high precision system clock when framerate is above the limit, but frame start timings are asynchronous and allowed to drift when the framerate is below the limit. In this mode frametime calculated at frame presentation points is jittering, but frametime calculated at frame start points is flat. This mode is minimum input latency oritented.
- Front edge sync - prioritizes synchronization over strict limit and synchronizes front edge of frame presentation call to high precision system clock. Other words, it synchronizes frame presentation timings. In this mode the limiter allows some frames to exceeed the limit to synchronize next frame presentation to clock after the hitch. In this mode frametime calculated at frame presentation points is flat, but frametime calculated at frame start points is jittering. This mode is not input latency oritented and it may increase due to artifically waiting between frame start and frame presentation points.
- Back edge sync - prioritizes synchronization over strict limit and synchronizes back edge of frame presentation call to high precision system clock. Other words, it synchronizes frame start timings. In this mode the limiter allows some frames to exceeed the limit to synchronize next frame start to clock after the hitch. In this mode frametime calculated at frame presentation points is jittering, but frametime calculated at frame start points is flat. This mode is minimum input latency oritented and behaves really close to async mode.

Hints:
- You may enable scanline sync in conjunction with front/back edge sync framerate limiting modes to activate hybrid scanline sync modes. In this case actual target scanline synchronization is performed just once on framerate limiting start then you can steer the tearline postiong with system clock.
- You may disable user interface tooltips via <User interface> tab in advanced properties.

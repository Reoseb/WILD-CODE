Percentile calculation mode
Affects the principles of percentile based 1% low and 0.1% low metrics calculation. Both metrics are based on sorted frametimes arrays and reflect instantaneous framerate calculated from a signle frametime located on a boundary of 1% or 0.1% of the slowest frames.
This option affects the definition of the boundary of 1% or 0.1% of the slowest frames. For linear percentile calculation mode it is static P99/P99.1 as is. Othwer words, it is 1% or 0.1% of total rendered frames count. Integral calculation mode is a bit more complext but more representative, it is boudnadry of the slowest frames taking 1% or 0.1% of total benchmark time.

- You may disable user interface tooltips via <User interface> tab in advanced properties.

Enable benchmark mode
Allows enabling benchmark statistics recording mode. In this mode %PRODUCTNAME% is calculating and optionally displaying the average, minimum, maximum, 1% low and 0.1% low framerates for all active 3D applications. 
Client applications like MSI Afterburner can also trigger the benchmark mode with hotkeys directly while running 3D applications and save results to a text file.

Hints:
- You may disable user interface tooltips via <User interface> tab in advanced properties.

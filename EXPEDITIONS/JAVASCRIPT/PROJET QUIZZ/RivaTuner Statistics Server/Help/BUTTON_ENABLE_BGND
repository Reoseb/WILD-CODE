Enable On-Screen Display shadow
Enables On-Screen Display shadow rendering. Shadow rendering can improve On-Screen Display readability in some applications by preventing the text from merging with solid screen color. 
Please take a note that shadow rendering increases performance hit caused by On-Screen Display rendering in vector modes, so enable it only when necessary.

Hints:
- Anticheat systems of some games may treat game code hooking required for application detection and On-Screen Display rendering as possible cheat and block connection to multiplayer server. To troubleshoot such issues try to add a profile for such game and disable On-Screen Display support, or if it doesn't help, try to decrease application detection level.
- You may disable user interface tooltips via <User interface> tab in advanced properties.

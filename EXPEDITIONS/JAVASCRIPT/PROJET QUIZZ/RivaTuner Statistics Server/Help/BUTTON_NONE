Application detection level : none
Disables detection for the application associated with the current profile. In this mode %PRODUCTNAME% doesn't collect runtime statistics, such as framerate, and doesn't provide additional services, such as On-Screen Display, to the associated application.

Hints:
- Some protected applications may treat executable code hooking required for proper application detection, statistics collection and On-Screen Display rendering as possible threat and refuse to run. To troubleshoot such issues try to add a profile for such application and decrease application detection level.
- You may disable user interface tooltips via <User interface> tab in advanced properties.

Shadow color
Displays shadow color for On-Screen Display and allows you to redefine it for vector On-Screen Display rendering modes. You can also adjust shadow color transparency level for vector 3D On-Screen Display rendering mode. Please take a note that shadow rendering increases performance hit caused by On-Screen Display rendering in vector modes, so enable it only when necessary.

Hints:
- Anticheat systems of some games may treat game code hooking required for application detection and On-Screen Display rendering as possible cheat and block connection to multiplayer server. To troubleshoot such issues try to add a profile for such game and disable On-Screen Display support, or if it doesn't help, try to decrease application detection level.
- You may disable user interface tooltips via <User interface> tab in advanced properties.

Application detection level : high
Selects high detection level for the application associated with the current profile. In this mode %PRODUCTNAME% intercepts application's calls to DirectDraw, Direct3D and OpenGL runtime libraries and intecepts application's attempts to load new libraries. 
This mode is recommended for collecting runtime statistics, such as framerate, and enabling additional services, such as On-Screen Display, in the applications loading DirectDraw, Direct3D and OpenGL runtime libraries dynamically.

Hints:
- Some protected applications may treat executable code hooking required for proper application detection, statistics collection and On-Screen Display rendering as possible threat and refuse to run. To troubleshoot such issues try to add a profile for such application and decrease application detection level.
- You may disable user interface tooltips via <User interface> tab in advanced properties.

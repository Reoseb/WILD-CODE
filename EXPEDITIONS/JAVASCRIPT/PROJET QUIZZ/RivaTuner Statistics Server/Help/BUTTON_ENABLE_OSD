Enable On-Screen Display support
Enables On-Screen Display support for the application associated with the current profile.

Hints:
- Anticheat systems of some games may treat game code hooking required for application detection and On-Screen Display rendering as possible cheat and block connection to multiplayer server. To troubleshoot such issues try to add a profile for such game and disable On-Screen Display support, or if it doesn't help, try to decrease application detection level.
- You may disable user interface tooltips via <User interface> tab in advanced properties.
